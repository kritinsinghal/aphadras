A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction, engineering, and scienctific proposals throughout the 20th and into the 21st century. The plans compromise proposals to land on mars, structural operations, designs and technologies used in the framework of the expedition, the basic requirements, eventually settling on and terraforming the planet, while utilizing its moons, Phobos and Deimos. Exploration of Mars to find out the possibility of existence of life in Mars has been a goal of national space programmes for decades. Failure has always raged us due to one or the other defaults in the system of exploration. This time, we come up with our new expedition, the Project Aphadras, involving a group of ten people. As the management, information and efficiency of our new project has shown no defaults yet, it can prove to be very successful in finding out the possibility of life beyond the dimensions of Earth. We are fully equiped with the latest technologies and the newest machines. We have come up with a new Space Shuttle that would reduce the chances of any inconvenience that could come on our way. The success % is 4 which has been the most of all. If we succeed, we could sustain the life of billions that are currently breathing and billions, that are yet to come. I have detailed, one by one, each sections of our department so as to satify, satiate and covince you to accept our proposal.
